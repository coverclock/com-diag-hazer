# Remarks

N.B. Most of the snapshots below were taken from earlier versions of Hazer and
its gpstool utility. The snapshots were cut and pasted from actual output and
may differ slightly (or greatly) from that of the most current version. For
some of these, a \* was used to mean the degree symbol; later versions of
Hazer display the actual degree symbol using Unicode. I've tried to update
the command line examples to reflect the current code, but I may have missed
a few here or there, or it may not have been possible due to the availability
of the hardware under test.

## Sending Commands

gpstool can send initialization commands to the GPS device. These can be either
NMEA sentences (without escape sequences) or binary UBX sentence (with
escape sequences). In either case, gpstool will automatically append the
appropriate ending sequences including a computed NMEA or UBX checksum.
Here is an example of gpstool writing proprietary NMEA and binary UBX sequences
to a NaviSys GR-701W which has a UBlox 7 chipset.

    > gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -E \
          -W "\$PUBX,00" \
          -W "\$PUBX,03" \
          -W "\$PUBX,04" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x01\\x08\\x00\\x02\\x13\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x0a\\x04\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x31\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x3e\\x00\\x00" \
          -W "\\xb5\\x62\\x06\\x06\\x00\\x00"

(The code to write commands to the device depends on being driven by incoming
data from the device, so if the device is initially silent, this won't work.
All the GPS receivers I've tested are chatty by default, so this hasn't been an
issue for me.)

If a written command is of zero length (really: has a NUL or \0 character as its
first character), gpstool exits. This can be used by a script, for example, to
use gpstool to send a command to change the baud rate of the GPS device serial
port and exit, and then start a new gpstool with the new baud rate.

As a special case, you can send initialization commands to a U-blox
device and wait until it responds with an ACK or NAK before sending the next
U-blox command.

    > gpstool -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 230400 -8 -n -1 \
        -U '\xb5\x62\x06\x8a\x09\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x01\x00\x03\x20\x00' \
        -U '\xb5\x62\x06\x8a\x09\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x05\x00\x53\x10\x00' \
        -U '\xb5\x62\x06\x8a\x09\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x04\x00\x77\x10\x01' \
        -U '\xb5\x62\x06\x8a\x09\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x04\x00\x78\x10\x00' \
        -U '\xb5\x62\x06\x8a\x09\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x6b\x02\x91\x20\x01' \
        -U '\xb5\x62\x06\x01\x03\x00\x01\x14\x01' \
        -U ''

## Forwarding Datagrams

Here is an example of using gpstool to read an NMEA sentence stream from a
serial device at 115200 8n1, display the data using ANSI escape sequences to
control the output terminal, and forwards NMEA sentences to a remote
instance of itself listing on port 5555 on host "lead".

## Using screen

You can use the screen utility, available for MacOS and Linux/GNU, to capture
the NMEA stream on a serial port. (And on Windows systems, I use PuTTY.)

## Using gpsd

You can test GPS devices independently of this software using the
excellent Linux open source GPS stack. Here is just a simple example of
stopping the GPS daemon if it has already been started (make sure you
are not going to break something doing this), restarting it in non-deamon
debug mode, and running a client against it. In this example, I use the
Garmin GLO Bluetooth device I have already set up, and the X11 GPS client.
When I'm done, I restart gpsd in normal daemon mode.

    > sudo service gpsd stop
    > gpsd -N /dev/rfcomm0 &
    > xgps
    ...
    > kill %+
    > sudo service start gpsd

## Using socat

You can use the socat utility, available for Linux/GNU and MacOS flavored
systems, to capture the NMEA stream on the UDP port.

    > socat UDP6-RECVFROM:5555,reuseaddr,fork STDOUT

    $GPGSA,M,3,32,10,14,18,31,11,24,08,21,27,01,,1.3,0.8,1.1*33
    $GPGSV,3,1,12,32,79,305,39,10,66,062,41,14,58,247,35,18,40,095,34*72
    $GPGSV,3,2,12,31,21,180,45,11,20,309,27,24,19,044,30,08,17,271,31*7A
    $GPGSV,3,3,12,21,13,156,39,27,13,233,33,01,09,320,20,51,43,183,42*72

You may be tempted (I was) to dispense with gpstool entirely and use
socat to forward NMEA strings to a remote site.  Be aware that when
used in UDP consumer mode, gpstool expects every UDP datagram to be
a fully formed NMEA sentence, because that's how it sends them in UDP
producer mode. socat isn't so polite. Since the occasional UDP packet
will inevitably be lost, if the output of socat is piped into gpstool,
it will see a lot of corruption in the input stream. Using gpstool on
both ends means only entire NMEA sentences are lost, and gpstool can
recover from this.

    > socat OPEN:/dev/ttyUSB0,b115200 UDP6-SENDTO:[::1]:5555

The RMC and GGA sentences contain UTC timestamps (and the RMC contains
a DMY datestamp). Hazer rejects sentences for which time runs backwards.
Although this should be impossible for the sentences in the stream from
a GPS device, it is entirely possible for the UDP stream from a Hazer
producer, since UDP packet ordering is not guaranteed.

You might be tempted to use TCP instead of UDP. That sounds like a good
idea: guaranteed delivery, packets always in order. However, this can
introduce a lot of lantency in the NMEA stream. The result is the NMEA
stream received by the consumer may lag signficantly behind real-time,
and that lag increases the longer the system runs. So over time it
diverges more and more with reality.  It is better to lose an NMEA
sentence than have it delayed. After all, another more up-to-date sentence
is on the way right behind it.

## Using Bluetooth

You can use gpstool with Bluetooth GPS units like the Garmin GLO.

    > sudo bluetoothctl
    power on
    agent on
    scan on
    ...
    pair 01:23:45:67:89:AB
    ...
    scan off
    quit
    > sudo rfcomm bind 0 01:23:45:67:89:AB 1
    > sudo chmod 666 /dev/rfcomm0

Look at the raw NMEA output using the standard socat tool. This lets you examine
the output of the device without depending on Hazer or Diminuto in any way.

    > socat -u OPEN:/dev/rfcomm0,b4800

Look at the raw NMEA output using the Diminuto serialtool. This is a good
functional test of the Diminuto serial port API that Hazer uses without
actually depending on Hazer.

    > serialtool -D /dev/rfcomm0 -b 4800 -8 -n -1

Run gpstool.

## Using One Pulse Per Second

Some GPS devices provide a 1Hz One Pulse Per Second (1PPS) signal that is, if
implemented correctly, closely phase locked to GPS time. Hazer and its
gpstool utility are user-space software running on a non-real-time operating
system, so any periodic action by Hazer is at best approximate in terms of
period. But handling 1PPS even with some jitter is useful for casual testing
of GPS devices.

You can test GPS devices like the NaviSys GR-701W that provide 1PPS by toggling
the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) modem control line. This includes devices that
have a USB serial interface. Note the addition of the -c flag.

You can also test GPS devices like the MakerFocus USB-Port-GPS that provide
1PPS by toggling a General Purpose I/O (GPIO) pin. This example (which I've run
on a Raspberry Pi) uses pin 18. Note the addition of the -I flag. (You may have
to run gpstool as root to access the GPIO pins.)

gpstool can assert an output GPIO pin in approximate syntonization with the
1PPS signal derived from either DCD or GPIO. This example (which I've run on a
Raspberry Pi with the GR-701W) uses pin 16. Note the addition of the -p flag.
(Again, you may have to run gpstool as root to access the GPIO pins.)

    # gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -n -1 -E -c -p 16

The GPIO functions implemented in Diminuto and used by gpstool may get confused
if gpstool exits ungracefully leaving GPIO pins configured. If necessary, you
can deconfigure GPIO pins using the Diminuto pintool utility

    # pintool -p 18 -n
    # pintool -p 16 -n

## True Versus Magnetic Bearings

GPS devices compute the true bearing by comparing successive position fixes to
determine your speed and direction. Hence, the true bearing, e.g. "135.000\*T",
is only reliable if you are moving, and at a speed fast enough to be within
the resolution of the accuracy of the position fix. The magnetic bearing is an
actual magnetic compass bearing, but is only provided by GPS devices which also
have a magnetic compass; otherwise it will be displayed as "0.000\*M". The
cardinal compass direction, e.g. "SE", is based on the true bearing.

## Google Earth Pro

In February 2017 I used Hazer with Google Earth Pro, the desktop version of the
web based application. Today, August 2018, the real-time GPS feature of Google
Earth Pro no longer seems to work with latest version, 7.3.2, for the Mac (I
haven't tried it for other operating systems). Neither does 7.3.1. But 7.1.8
works.

Google Earth Pro only accepts GPS data on a serial port, or at least something
that kinda sorta looks like a serial port. I've used a FIFO (named pipe), via
the mkfifo(1) command, for stuff like this in the past, but there doesn't seem
to be any way to get Pro to recognize the FIFO; only serial(ish) devices may
apply here.

So I processed the NMEA stream from a serial-attached GPS device using gpstool
running on a Raspberry Pi, then forwarded it via UDP datagrams to another
gpstool on the Raspberry Pi. (This is the bin/producer.sh script.)

    gpstool -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 4800 -8 -n -1 -6 -c -G ip6-localhost:5555 -E

Then I used the second gpstool to forward the NMEA stream out a serial port
across a two FTDI USB-to-serial adaptors hooked back-to-back with a null
modem in between, to a Mac running Google Earth Pro. (This is the
bin/provider.sh script.)

    gpstool -G :5555 -K -D /dev/ttyUSB1 -b 4800 -8 -n -1

I used the "GPS Import Realtime" drop down menu in Google Earth Pro to select
the USB serial device representing the other end of the FTDI "milking
machine". The menu liked the device "/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXXXXXX" where the Xs
are some kind of internal identifier on MacOS where Pro was running.

## NMEA TXT Sentences

Some devices are chatty and emit interesting and sometimes useful information
as NMEA TXT sentences. These are recognized by Hazer and logged by gpstool.
Some of the functional tests save standard error output in log files under the
build artifact directory, or redirected to the system log using the Diminuto
log command.

## Phantom GPS Satellite PRN 4

Around 2018-11-29T12:00-07:00, I was testing some changes to Hazer with
the Ublox-8 based BU353W10 receiver by comparing its results to those
of the web site <https://in-the-sky.org/satmap_radar.php> that presents
a real-time sky map of the visible orbiting space vehicles (not just
GPS). I noticed that my BU353W10 was reporting GPS PRN 4 as "in view"
with a zero elevation and zero azimuth; that vehicle wasn't reported by
the sky map. Worse: a little web-search-fu told me that there was no PRN
4; it does not appear in the most recent GPS almanac. The GPS vehicle
using PRN 4 was decommisioned and its pseudo-random number code has
not yet been reused.

Before I could do much else, PRN 4 dropped from view.

PRN 4 reappeared the next morning around 2018-11-30T09:00-07:00. I
quickly dumped the raw NMEA and verified using NMEA 0183 Version 4.10
pp. 96-97 that I wasn't decoding the GSV sentence incorrectly.

    $GPGSV,4,1,15,04,,,36,05,04,062,22,10,27,253,32,13,32,053,38*43\r\n
    $GPGSV,4,2,15,15,60,092,39,16,15,289,26,20,53,269,,21,72,336,22*75\r\n
    $GPGSV,4,3,15,24,06,129,33,26,10,264,15,27,11,322,31,29,36,170,50*78\r\n
    $GPGSV,4,4,15,46,38,215,45,48,36,220,43,51,44,183,44*43\r\n

However, I noticed that the elevation and azimuth for PRN 4 weren't actually
zero: they were empty strings, although the SNR was a reasonable (and changing
over time) value. I coded up a change to Hazer to detect this and mark it, and
to gpstool to display a '?' next to that SAT entry. I was able to test this
before PRN 4 again dropped from view.

PRN 4 reappeared about twenty minutes later.

It continued to drop from view and reappear. Its period of appearance does
not coincide with the GPS orbital period.

Neither NMEA 0183 4.10 nor Ublox 8 R15 suggests any interpretation of the
empty elevation and azimuth fields. As always, I'm assuming this somehow is
a bug in my code. But it does occur to me that PRN 4 would be useful for
testing a ground-based GPS transmitter; the period of its appearance would
make sense for a transmitter in the continental America time zones.

Checking the FAA Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) notifications on the web, there are
GPS disruptions scheduled for the late November/early December time frame,
centered on the White Sands Missle Range (WSMR) in New Mexico, and the Yuma
Proving Grounds (YPG) in Arizona, either of which is potentially within
range of my location in Denver Colorado. So this could be the U.S. military
doing testing.

I temporarily added code to gpstool to monitor the comings and goings
of GPS PRN 4 and remark upon them in the system log. Here's an example
of what those log messages look like during an actual run of just a
few hours. '#' is the initial state value when gpstool starts running,
'?' means GPS PRN 4 came into view, and ' ' means it exited from view. The
log also includes the initial and maximum signal strength, and the
transmission duration in milliseconds.  All clock times are in MST.

Here is the log for a twenty-four hour period.

The durations in this sample last for anywhere from a second to half an hour.
During this period the transmissions ceased at 20:00MST and resumed at 06:00MST.
This seems correlated with typical "working hours" in the U.S. continental
time zones.

On 2018-12-04, the U. S. Coast Guard straightened me out.

On 2018-12-23, the first of the next generation Block IIIA GPS satellites
was launched.

    OUT AND TESTING PRIOR TO BEING SET HEALTHY.  A USABINIT NANU WILL
    BE SENT WHEN THE SATELLITE IS SET ACTIVE TO SERVICE.
    *** GENERAL MESSAGE TO ALL GPS USERS ***

Note that the new satellite uses PRN 4. I suspect now that the earlier
use of PRN 4 by SVN36 was some kind of control segment testing in advance
of the launch of SVN74.

## GPS Constellation Status 2019-02-20

The Global Positioning Systems Directoriate proposed a change to the
"Navstar GPS Control Segment to User Support Community Interfaces"
(ICD-GPS-240 and ICD-GPS-87) to modify the GPS Operational Advisory
Message to eliminate information about the orbital plane/slot and clock.
This change was approved by the Interface Control Working Group on
2018-12. I've captured a portion of a recent Advisory Message here to
snapshot this information before it is removed.

## Ardusimple SimpleRTK2B

The Ardusimple SimpleRTK2B board features a ZED-F9P "9th generation" U-Blox
chip. It can be equipped with radios like the ZigBee-based XBee. This allows
one SimpleRTK2B to be used as a stationary "base" in high-precision "survey-in"
mode, and a second SimpleRTK2B in mobile "rover" mode; the base transmits
position corrections to the rover via the radio using the RTCM protocol once
the survey has been completed to the configured level of accuracy. This
is a form of Differential GNSS and can, over time, achieve very high position
(and time) accuracy and precision.

In the diagram above I show where you would connect the XBee configuration tool
XCTU, or the u-blox configuration tool u-center, but in normal use I only have
a host running gpstool connected.

I used XCTU to configure the XBee radio (setting it to Transparent mode, as a
Zigbee Router, and a serial port baud rate of 38400 8N1) and persist that
configuration in the XBee's non-volatile memory.

The ZED-F9P is configured at run-time using gpstool to send it commands. This
configuration is in volatile memory so that the GPS receiver reverts back to its
factory defaults when it is power cycled. Among other things, this allows me to
use SimpleRTK2B boards interchangeably in the field.

## Google Maps

The mapstool  utility converts strings containing latitude and longitude
coordinates of various formats (several of which are output by the gpstool
utility) into a decimal degrees format that is understood by Google Maps.
You can cut and paste the output of mapstool directly into the search bar
of the Google Maps web page.

    $ mapstool "39.794212196, -105.153349930"# HPP format
    39.794212196, -105.153349930
    
    $ mapstool "39 47 39.16390(N) 105 09 12.05974(W)"# NGS format
    39.794212194, -105.153349928
    
    $ mapstool "39°47'39.163\"N, 105°09'12.060\"W"# POS format
    39.794211944, -105.153350000

HPP is the U-blox UBX High Precision Position format. It is also a format
directly supported by Google Maps.

NGS is the format used in the National Geodetic Survey datasheets. It is
mostly for this format that I wrote this utility.

POS is the standard gpstool format. It is also a format (minus the BASH
backslash escapes) directly supported by Google Maps.

Nine significant fractional digits are used in the decimal degrees output
because that allows for about three significant fractional seconds digits for
the input. Also, billionths of a degree is the precision provided by the UBX
HPP format.

## Haversine and Geodesic Distances

The utility haversine computes the distance between two coordinates expressed
in decimal degrees using the Haversine algorithm based on great circles. This
is a simple trigonometric approach that (incorrectly) assumes the Earth is a
perfect sphere. The output is expressed in meters. The input can be cut and
pasted directly from the mapstool utility (see above).

    $ haversine 39.794212194, -105.153349928 39.794211944, -105.153350000
    0.0285029342

The utility geodesic computes the distance between two coordinates expressed
in decimal degress using the Geodesic algorithm based on an elliptical model
of the Earth from the WGS84 datum (this is a model used by most GPS receivers).
The output is expressed in meters. The input can be cut and pasted directly
from the mapstool utility (see above). This is a more accurate, but much
more computationally complex, approach than using great circles. This utility
makes use of the geodesic.h and geodesic.c files from Charles F. F. Karney's
geographiclib, which is licensed under the MIT license.

    $ geodesic 39.794212194, -105.153349928 39.794211944, -105.153350000
    0.0284344407

## Stupid Cat Tricks

gpstool has a couple of deliberate design features that might seem to be
problems, but they are there for a reason.

gpstool can be configured to receive NMEA sentences, UBX packets, and RTCM
messages via datagrams using User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This approach has
a big security hole: this technique has no authentication mechanism, nor is
the data stream encrypted. This allows gpstool to be spoofed by another
computer sending it bogus datagrams, or for a Man In The Middle attack to
spy on the data being forwarded.

I used UDP specifically because of its low overhead and the fact that
datagrams are tossed away rather than being sent late if the sending
queue somehow becomes clogged. I wrote about this at length in my blog.

C. Overclock, "Better Never Than Late", 2017-02-16,
<https://coverclock.blogspot.com/2017/02/better-never-than-late.html>

One of my complaints about the various encrypted-UDP schemes is
that most of the ones I have studied defeat the entire advantage of
using UDP by implementing TCP-like behavior in user-space on top
of UDP. However, it is trivial to use other tools to tunnel the UDP
output of gpstool through an encrypted connection.

You will also notice that there is no buffering between the source
of input data - be it standard input, a UDP socket, a serial port,
or a named pipe - and the NMEA, UBX, and RTCM state machines that feed
validated data into the processing stage of gpstool. This was done for
much the same reason: to keep gpstool as real-time as possible. It is
better to lose some data - after all, a solution update will typically
arrive in the next second - and have to resynchronize to the input stream
because gpstool could not keep up with the input source, than to add
latency to the display of the positioning, navigation, and timing
information.

However, it is really easy to add buffering - potentially a lot of it - just
by rethinking the command line. When you connect two applications via a pipe

    ls -l | more

you are creating an asynchronous ring buffer between the data source
(ls -l) and the data sink (more). According to pipe(7), the buffer is
sixteen virtual pages in size. With a typical virtual page size of four
kilobytes (which is true of all the systems I regularly use, including
the Raspberry Pi 4), that makes the buffer sixty-four kilobytes in size.

So you can add a bunch of buffering just by using a utility like socat
(socket catenate) to read data from the input source (like a serial port
in this example) and pipe it to gpstool.

    socat -u OPEN:/dev/ttyACM0,b9600 - | gpstool -S - -E

You can add even more buffering, sixty-four kilobytes at a time, by
adding more cat commands.

    socat -u OPEN:/dev/ttyACM0,b9600 - | cat | cat | gpstool -S - -E

Do this enough (like I have) and the latency will become obvious as
you notice a discrepancy between the actual system time reported in
the gpstool "LOC" (local) output line and the GNSS time reported in
the gpstool "TIM" (time) output line.

## Time Dilation

Due to the centripetal acceleration in their orbits, the atomic clocks
in the GPS satellites run slower than atomic clocks on the ground,
losing 7us per day (Special Relativity).

Due to the altitude of their orbits placing them further from the mass
of the Earth, the atomic clocks in the GPS satellites run faster than
atomic clocks on the ground, gaining 45us per day (General Relativity).

The net effect is that the atomic clocks in the GPS satellites gain
38us per day. This has to be taken into account in the calculation of
the position solutions.

## Microsoft CBL-Mariner 1.0

Microsoft has released its own Fedora-like distribution of Linux -
CBL-Mariner 1.0 (for Common Base Linux) - indended for its Azure
cloud service. I easily got it running in a virtual machine using
VMware Fusion on my desktop Mac, ported my Diminuto C library and
Hazer GPS project over to it, and geolocated like a boss using a
BU353W10 USB dongle. It does have some wierdness: it's lacks the
Unicode fonts to display the degree and plus minus symbols (trying
to address this), the Diminuto IPv6 unit tests don't work (will
look at this), and the Makefile requires single backslashes
instead of the double backslashes that I've had to use in more
recent Linux distros (no clue, it's a recent version of make).

## GNSS Restrictions

Formerly: restricted operation above 18,000m (59,000') altitude and
1000knots (510m/s) (1,900km/hr) (1,180mph) velocity.

Currently (as of 2016): prohibits decryption of precise positioning
signals, steerable antennas designed to avoid jamming, design to
deliver 500kg payload at least 300km.

(Many current commercial receivers will of course still have the former
restrictions in place, implemented in HW, FW, or SW.)

## Tunneling UDP datagrams over SSL using Stagecoach

(Warning: this describes an experimental work in progress.)

The Stagecoach sub-project in the Codex repository

<https://github.com/coverclock/com-diag-codex>

implements a tool that forwards UDP datagrams over an TCP SSL tunnel
and returns response datagrams to the UDP sender. This can be used on
the remote Tumbleweed Rover to forward Hazer gpstool update requests
(which are just empty RTCM messages) to the remote Hazer Tumbleweed
rtktool router, which will respond with the latest RTCM update from the
remote Hazer Tumbleweed base.

From the Stagecoach documentation:

> Stagecoach provides an SSL tunnel between two UDP endpoints while
> preserving datagram boundaries. It is agnostic as to the data being
> passed via UDP, but it was written specifically to provide this capability
> for the gpstool utility that is part of the Hazer project. gpstool can
> forward NMEA sentences, RTK messages, or CSV packets to UDP port, but
> lacks any authentication or encryption capability. In this manner,
> Stagecoach serves as a proxy for the server on the client end, and
> as a proxy for the client on the server end.

## Testing the SparkFun LoRa Serial Radios

As part of the Fothergill project, I'm playing with the SparkFun LoRa serial
radios. These radios come as a set of two pre-paired LoRa radios, and can be
powered and communicated with via USB C cables. Testing with them has suggested
they are fiercely slow and prone to disconnect.

<https://www.sparkfun.com/products/20029>

They enumerate as serial modems.

* Device ttyACM
* Serial 57600 baud 8n1
* USB Vendor 1b4f
* USB Product 002a
* Frequency 902-928 MHz
* Channels 50
* Frequency Hopping
* Broadcast Power 30dbm
* Airspeed 4800 bps (about 480 bytes/second including overhead)
* AES Encryption
* Software CRC

To sanity test these, I ran the Diminuto loopback utility on one Raspberry Pi

    loopback -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 57600 -8 -n -1 -d

with the standard screen utility on a second Raspberry Pi

    screen /dev/ttyACM0 57600 8n1

and just verified that what I typed on the second Pi was echoed back verbatim.

## Binary Files

The recent xz utilities debacle (in which a developer who has been working
on the open source xz compression utilities for several years inserted
a trojan into the repo in the form of a binary executable which could
create backdoor into the host bypassing SSH security) incentivized me to
remove the files under dat - which were mostly captured output -
except those few that are used for functional testing. The entire former
dat contents can be found under a new repo

<https://github.com/coverclock/com-diag-hazer-dat>

for which there is no dependency in Hazer. The few binary files in dat that
are used for functional testing are now uuencoded (not that that makes them
any more obvious as to what they are).

## Real-Time Scheduling and PREEMPT_RT

If the gpstool '''-r''' flag is used, the application will attempt to
use the Linux First In, First Out thread scheduler ('''SCHED_FIFO''')
for the thread used to sense and forward the 1PPS signal, if so
configured. gpstool supports the sensing of the toggling of either a
General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pin, or the Data Carrier Detect (DCD)
indication on the GNSS device serial port, to indicate 1PPS. In either
case, it uses a dedicated thread to manage this, and - if configured -
to forward the 1PPS signal to another GPIO pin. Using the FIFO scheduler,
with a high priority, is an attempt to reduce the jitter in sensing
and fowarding 1PPS. But using a real-time Linux thread scheduler, such
as First In, First Out, or Round Robin ('''SCHED_RR'''), requires that
gpstool be run as root.
