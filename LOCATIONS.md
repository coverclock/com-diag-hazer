# Locations

The latitudes and longitudes below are based on various datums, which
may not be specified.

## Meade's Ranch, Kansas

Meade's Ranch, a private property in Kansas, contains the Geodetic Center of
the contiguous forty-eight states of the United States.

39°13’26.71220″N, 98°32’31.74540″W (2012)

39.224087, -98.542152

## GPS Meridian

Just a few yards east of the Prime Meridian at the Greenwich Observatory
in Greenwich (near London) England likes the GPS meridian. The GPS and the
Prime meridians differ by virtue of the fact that the two systems used
different datums.

51°28’40″N, 0°00’00″W (WGS84)

## Prime Meridian

At the Royal Observatory in Greenwich (near London) England.

## Point Nemo

Latin for "no one", this is the location on Earth that is the furthest
from land in all directions. It's been said that at this location the
nearest humans are sometimes on the International Space Station as it
passes overhead. It is in the Pacific Ocean.

48°52.5′S, 123°23.6′W

## Null Island

When your GNSS application has a bug and it ends up telling you you're at
latitude and longitude all zeros, you've found "Null Island". There isn't
actually an island there, but there might be a bouy with weather sensors.
Null Island is in the Atlantic Ocean off the western coast of Africa in the
Gulf of Guinea.

## Homestead at Bruin, Elliot County, Kentucky

This is old Greene family home where I used to spend my summers growing up.

## KK1446

This is a NGS marker at which I do a lot of testing. The fact that
the view of the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains is spectacular
from here is just a happy coincidence. Easy parking and access to
the marker is also a good thing. This location is so useful, I once
ran into a professional surveyor who was using KK1446 to calibrate his
equipment; he told me he often brings his lunch to eat there.

## R'lyeh

H. P. Lovecraft was an early twentieth-century writer and inventor of the genre now
known as "cosmic horror". In his fiction, Lovecraft placed R'lyeh at these coordinates
in the South Pacific Ocean, about mid-way between New Zealand and Chili. R'lyeh is the
pre-Cambrian sunken city where his malevolent giant alien-god Cthulhu hibernates,
perhaps having fled from other similar cosmic entities with which he was in conflict.
Cthulhu sleeps, dreaming of rising and resuming his dominion over the planet Earth,
while human cultists today worship him.

“Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fhtagn! Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!”
