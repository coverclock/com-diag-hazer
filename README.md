# Disclaimer

I am a software developer. I have been working full time the field
since 1976. I have an M.S. (1983) and a B.S. (1980) in computer science
from an accredited program at a university. What I am not is a
hardware or radio engineer, nor am I an expert in global navigation
satellite systems. Behind all the software work I present here is a
vast collection of hardware, firmware, and radio frequency expertise
contributed by the developers of the GNSS products I use.

If you're wondering why I don't use the excellent open source GPS Daemon
(gpsd) and its GPS Monitor (gpsmon), the answer is: I have, in many
projects, typically in conjunction with the open source NTPsec Daemon
(ntpd). Hazer was developed as an excuse for me to learn in detail
more about how GPS works and how NMEA and UBX sentences are formatted
(because I only learn by doing), and also to develop an NMEA and UBX
parsing library that I can incorporate into the kinds of embedded systems
I am frequently called to work upon. Hazer and gpstool have also turned
out to be really useful tools for testing and evaluating GPS devices.

# Abstract

This file is part of the Digital Aggregates Corporation Hazer
project. Hazer is a toolkit for interpreting data streams typically
generated by GPS and other GNSS receivers and emitted from serial(ish)
ports, including USB and Bluetooth.  While Hazer is the name of the
repository, it incorporates features in support of five different
related projects described below:

* Hazer (NMEA support),
* Yodel (UBX support including IMU),
* Tumbleweed (RTCM support),
* Wheatstone (LTE-M support), and
* Tesoro (OSM support).

The Hazer repo includes parsers for three different input formats - NMEA,
UBX, and RTCM - and interprets many of the data records represented in
those formats into C structures.  For purposes of commenting in my C code,
I find it useful to refer to NMEA records as "sentences" (terminology
consistent with the NMEA standard), UBX records as "packets", and RTCM
records as "messages".

NMEA sentences are printable ASCII messages that conform
to the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) 0183 4.10
specification. NMEA 0183 describes the output produced by most receiving
devices of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), of which the
U.S. Global Positioning System (GPS), formerly known as Navstar, is an
example. The NMEA software stack is named Hazer (same as the Git repository).

UBX packets are in a proprietary binary data format generated by devices
made by U-Blox, a Swiss designer and manufacturer of GNSS receivers. UBX
packets may include not only data generated by the GNSS receiver, but
also data generated by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), part of a
Inertial Navigation System (INS). UBX is supported by a parallel stack
called Yodel.

RTCM messages are in a binary data format used in Differential GNSS (DGNSS)
that makes use of Real-Time Kinematics (RTK). This allows communicating GNSS
receivers to compare notes and potentially, over time, achieve very high
degrees of precision down to centimeters. RTCM was developed by the Radio
Technical Commision for Maritime services (RTCM). RTCM is supported by a
parallel stack called Tumbleweed.

More broadly: Hazer uses GNSS to do geolocation for applications like
moving map displays; Yodel uses GNSS with high precision geolocation and
integrated inertial measurement features of specific u-blox devices;
and Tumbleweed uses Differental GNSS with specific u-blox devices.
All three projects reside in the Hazer repository.

When I use the term "Hazer", I am not very good about distinguishing whether
I am talking about the software stack, the project, or the entire repo.

Hazer includes a gpstool application as a kind of Swiss Army knife for dealing
with various GNSS devices. gpstool accepts data streams from standard input,
from serial(ish) devices, or from a UDP socket, and can send validated data to
a remote UDP socket, write it to a device, and display the interpreted
information.

Hazer also includes a rtktool application that is a point-to-multipoint GNSS
router that can receive data via a UDP socket from a remote gpstool and
forward it to one or more remote gpstools via UDP. This is used along with
gpstool to implement a DGNSS system using a stationary base station in survey
mode to provide real-time corrections to one or more mobile rovers. This
project, called Tumblweed (same as the RTCM software stack), does not use
the Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol (Ntrip), but instead
uses its own trivial data format consisting of raw RTCM messages preceeded
by a four-byte sequence number carried over UDP datagrams.

This software is an original work of its author.

# Dependencies

## Diminuto

The Hazer library and its utilities depend on my Diminuto library.
Diminuto is a general purpose C-based systems programming library that
supports serial port configuration, socket-based communication, and a
passle of other useful stuff. gpstool and rtktool are excellent examples
of how to leverage Diminuto to get a lot done in not so much C code. I
use Diminuto in virtually all of my C-based projects, and sometimes in
other languages too that support C-linkage.  Portions of Diminuto have
also shipped in products from several of my clients. (Details of building
Diminuto are shown below.)

## Tool Chain

These days most Linux distributions do not include the basic tools
to build C and C++ software (despite having themselves been developed
using them).

    sudo apt-get install gcc
    sudo apt-get install g++
    sudo apt-get install make

## Documentation

If you want to make documentation, doxygen and related tools will
need to be installed.

    sudo apt-get install doxygen
    sudo apt-get install texlive-base
    sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended
    sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra
    sudo apt-get install texlive-science

## Utilities

Some of the Hazer scripts use command line utilities that not all
Linux/GNU distros install by default.

    sudo apt-get install bc
    sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
    sudo apt-get install socat

## Workflow
    
For my own development workflow, I have also found it useful to install
other packages that are often optional in various Linux/GNU distros. Your
mileage may vary.

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server
    sudo apt-get install git
    sudo apt-get install vim
    sudo apt-get install screen

## LFS

The dat directory is where I collect data from tests of Hazer (moving
map), Tumblweeed (differential GNSS), and Yodel (integrated intertial
measurement). Some of the comma separated value (CSV) files are too large
(over a hundred megabytes uncompressed) to be pushed to GitHub in the
normal way. These files use GitHub's Large File Storage (LFS).

    sudo apt-get install git-lfs

Unless you install GitHub's LFS feature (which manifests as the "git lfs"
command), files stored in LFS will appear to have contents that look
something like this.

    version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1
    oid sha256:bcb222ac76e51cad8010086754d4cadeeebd0161b51029d6870a0d806db5f42f
    size 137136500

You have to initialize LFS once per machine for every repo it is used in.

    git lfs install

You can also safely skip installing LFS, and ignore the large data files, to
use this repo.

## geodesic

The geodesic application is based on algorithms described in

> Charles F. F. Karney, "Algorithms for geodesics", *Journal for Geodesy*,
> 2013-01, 87.1, pp. 43..55

and uses one .c file and one .h file, included in this repository, that were
written by Mr. Karney. The original source files can be found at

> <https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io>

and are licensed under the MIT license.

## locale

The gpstool, rtktool, and mapstool programs depend on running in a POSIX
locale that allows the use of Unicode characters like the degree symbol.
Locales like "POSIX" and "C" don't support this, at least not on the
systems I have. Locales like "en_US.UTF-8" work okay. Your mileage
may vary.

## dialout

GNSS modules typically express a serial port - either an actual serial
port, a USB serial port emulation ('''ttyUSB'''), or a modem emulation
('''ttyACM'''). The easiest way to get read/write access to such a port
as a non-root user is by adding that user to the '''dialout''' group.
The user may have to log out and back in again to have this take effect.

    sudo adduser pi dialout

# Reverse Dependencies

## Tesoro

The Tesoro project integrates Hazer with an OpenStreetMaps (OSM) tile
server to create a moving map display. Tesoro steers the display by
taking location updates, in the form of datagrams containing JSON over
UDP, either in real-time or from playback, from Hazer using scripts like
csvfollow and csvplayback.

# Versioning

Both Hazer and Diminuto are complex enough that I moved to a "master" and
"develop" dual branch model of development. I make and test major changes
in the "develop" branch, and when I think I have a stable release, I merge
"develop" into the "master" branch. I still make what I consider to be minor
changes in the master branch.

I still try to tag releases with a three-number tuple that is defined in the
build Makefile for each project. Release numbers, e.g. 22.2.1, consist of a
major number (22), a minor number (2), and a build number (1). The major
number changes when I've made a change significant enough that I think
applications using the library will likely need to be changed, even though
they may compile. The minor number changes when I've added new features or
functionality, but existing features and functionality haven't changed. The
build number changes when I've fixed a bug so that existing features or
functionality works as described (even though this may break workarounds in
applications).

The major and minor numbers are incorporated into the name of the shared
object (dynamic link library) produced by the build.

The vintage is the date and time of the most recent build in UTC and expressed
in ISO8601 format.

The revision is the Git commit number.

The release, revision, vintage, and a bunch of other stuff, are embedded as
modules in the Hazer and Diminuto libraries. Those modules can be linked into
an application. Each project has a binary executable named vintage that
displays this information.

The gpstool and rtktool applications can be run with a -V flag to display the
release, vintage, and revision of the Hazer library with which they were
built.

Tumbleweed recognizes RTCM messages with a valid CRC but does not process
their contents. As a special case, an RTCM message with a zero payload length
is used by gpstool and rtktool as a keep alive message.

# Talkers

Hazer recognizes the following talkers as belonging to the corresponding
constellations and systems.

These talkers have been observed in the wild coming from actual GPS receivers.

* GA - Galileo (as in Galileo Galilei) - EU
* GB - BeiDou 2 (as in The Big Dipper) a.k.a. COMPASS - China
* GL - Globalnaya Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS) - Russia
* GN - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) - Generic
* GP - Global Positioning System (GPS) a.k.a. Navstar GPS - USA

Support for these talkers has been unit tested but the talkers have never been
observed in the wild.

* BD - BeiDou (as in The Big Dipper) - China
* QZ - Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) - Japan

# Identifiers

Receivers that implement the GSA System ID field introduced in NMEA 4.10
may reuse satellite identifiers. For example, I see GPS and Galileo both
using identifier 9 on the U-Blox 9 receiver. Despite NMEA and vendor
documentation to the contrary, I do not find the satellite identifer
convention reliable and only use it as a last resort on older receivers
that do not implement the System ID field to identify the constellation.
Hazer recognizes the following satellite identifiers in the GSA and GSV
messages.

These satellite identifiers have been observed in the wild coming from actual
GPS receivers.

* GPS - 1..32
* SBAS - 33..64
* GLONASS - 65..96

Support for these satellite identifiers has been unit tested but has
never been exercised using actual GPS receivers.

* IMES - 173..182
* QZSS - 193..197
* BeiDou - 201..235
* Galileo - 301..336
* BeiDou 2 - 401..437

# Platforms

I have tested Hazer and run gpstool on the following platforms, in no
particular order. This list is not exhaustive, and just serves as an
example of the wide variety of possible computers one may use. Your
mileage may vary. Hazer and gpstool are not resource intensive; I routinely
run gpstool on an old 32-bit Intel i686 netbook, and run four instances of
gpstool simultaneously on a single Raspberry Pi 4B.

# Diagnostics

## Errors

Error messages may be logged by gpstool with the following error numbers
(errno) for malformed input data. (Errors reported by system calls and
library functions may also cause error messages not related to the input
data to be logged.)

* EINVAL - invalid character in a field e.g. alpha in a numeric field.
* EIO - error in the end matter e.g. checksum or cyclic redundancy check (CRC).
* ENODATA - below minimum length or number of fields.
* ENOMSG - error in the begin matter e.g. no discernable identifiers.
* ERANGE - time, latitude, longitude, etc. value out of range.

Each Hazer library function that parses NMEA sentences (hazer), UBX packets
(yodel), or RTCM messages (tumbleweed) returns a value >= 0 if the data were
valid and any PNT structures passed to the function were updated. If the
function returns a value < 0, the data were rejected, and errno is set
to a value. If errno > 0, then the data were invalid and the error number,
as indicated in the list above, suggests the reason why. If errno == 0, then
the data were valid but indicated that the GNSS device did not have a valid
solution, so the PNT structures were not updated.

## Synchronization

The following log messages regarding input stream synchronization may
be reported by gpstool.

* Sync Start - one of the state machines has signaled that a valid NMEA, UBX, or RTCM frame has been read with expected beginning and ending matter, including a correct checksum or CRC. The input stream is synchronized where it had not been before.
* Sync Stop - all three state machines have entered their stop states. This indicates that all have given up trying to synchronize to the input stream. All three state machines will be restarted.
* Sync Lost - the input stream had been synchronized, but at the beginning of the next frame, none of the expected beginning matter for a NMEA, UBX, or RTCM frame was recognized. All three state machines will be restarted.

astronomers in the audience, but it wasn't to me.

# Build

## Diminuto

Clone and build Diminuto, which is used by gpstool although not by libhazer.
(Or follow the directions in the Diminuto README.)

    cd ~
    mkdir -p src
    cd src
    git clone https://github.com/coverclock/com-diag-diminuto
    cd com-diag-diminuto/Diminuto
    make pristine
    make depend
    make all

## Hazer

Clone and build Hazer. (If you don't build Diminuto where the Hazer Makefile
expects it, some minor Makefile hacking might be required.)

    cd ~
    mkdir -p src
    cd src
    git clone https://github.com/coverclock/com-diag-hazer
    cd com-diag-hazer/Hazer
    make pristine
    make depend
    make all

## Documentation

You can make HTML, man page, and PDF documentation based on the Doxygen
comments embedded in the source code by using the following make targets.

    make documentation
    make manuals

You can find the resulting documentation in the following directories.
The variable TARGET will be replaced by "host" unless you are using some
special Makefile configuration (for example, for cross-compilation).

    out/${TARGET}/doc/html
    out/${TARGET}/doc/man
    out/${TARGET}/doc/pdf

(Diminuto has a similer documentation build process.)

## Administration

The fs directory contains a file system overlay of files that I've found
useful to carefully install in system directories like /etc and /lib.
It is not installed automatically, because whether they are helpful, or
they reduce your target system to a smoking heap of silicon, depends on your
exact circumstances: the target system, the version of Linux it runs, etc.
Some of the files under fs are new files in their entirety, some just contain
lines that need to be added to the indicated files.

Most Linux distros will require the program accessing the GPS/GNSS
device to either have root privileges or be in the "dialout" group.
The latter is of course preferred.

    sudo usermod -a -G dialout ${USER}

${USER} will need to log out and back in for this to take effect.

It is also possible to edit the udev rules to make the device
readable and writeable by the ${USER} (okay) or anyone (nope).

Depending on what features of Hazer you choose to use, you will need
to define some services in the /etc/services file. The port numbers are
your choices to make. Note that the TCP and UDP port numbers for the same
service (e.g. tesoro) can be (and typically are) the same number. Port
number values may range from 0 to 65353 and must be unique. Linux also
assigns "ephemeral" or temporary port numbers which will not appear in
the /etc/services file.

    tumbleweed 22222/udp  # Tumbleweed RTK source/sink
    tesoro     33333/tcp  # Tesoro JSON source
    tesoro     33333/udp  # Tesoro JSON sink
    hazer      44444/udp  # Hazer NMEA source/sink

## Unit Tests

Set up environment and run tests and utilities. (This establishes the paths
for both the Hazer and the Diminuto executables so you don't have to install
the libraries and binaries in the system directories.)

    cd ~/src/com-diag-hazer/Hazer
    . out/host/bin/setup
    make sanity
    
## Functional Tests

There are a bunch of scripts that use actual hardware. Some of them require
home-built test fixtures and General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins. But
there is a small collection of functional tests that do not require any
GNSS device at all. Mostly I use these to make sure that gpstool does not
throw an assert and core dump.

    cd ~/src/com-diag-hazer/Hazer
    . out/host/bin/setup
    make functional

# Environmental Variables

    COM_DIAG_HAZER_SAVDIR

Some scripts in the bin and fun directories save stdout, stderr, CSV,
or DGNSS parameters in files.  Setting this environmental variable
changes the directory in which these files are stored. By default,
stdout, stderr, and CSV files are stored in the out/${TARGET}/tmp
subdirectory of the code base, where TARGET is set to the name of the
Makefile configuration file (typically "host"). The DGNSS parameters are
saved in ${HOME}/fix, or if ${HOME} is not set, in /var/tmp/fix. All of
these defaults are overridden if the environmental variable is set.

    COM_DIAG_DIMINUTO_LOG_MASK

Sets the default log mask for Diminuto for those applications that set
the log mask from the environment. The value is an eight-bit number
in decimal, hexadecimal, or even octal. In addition, the string "~0"
can be used to enable all log levels.

# Comma Separated Value (CSV) Output

The -T flag for gpstool will cause the utility to save the current
Position, Velocity, Time (PVT) solution once a second to a "trace"
file in CSV format as described below. This makes it easy to analyze
results using tools like Excel and several tools provided by Hazer itself.
The PVT solution is taken from the high precision u-blox UBX-NAV-HPPOSLLH
message if it is available, from the ensemble GNSS solution if it exists,
or from one of the four Global Satellite Navigation Systems solutions in
this order of preference: GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou. The attitude
(roll, pitch, yaw) is taken from the UBX-NAV-ATT message from the IMU
if it is available. Fields which are not available or are not supported
by the receiver have values coded as "0." instead of an empty string to
simplify parsing in post-processing.

* NAM - 0: hostname of computer running gpstool.
* NUM - 1: sequence number of observation.
* FIX - 2: 0=no fix, 1=dead reckoning, 2=2D, 3=3D, 4=combined, 5=time only.
* SYS - 3: 0=ensemble, 1=GPS, 2=GLONASS, 3=GALILEO, 4=BEIDOU.
* SAT - 4: number of satellites used in position fix.
* CLK - 5: local time in decimal seconds since the POSIX Epoch.
* TIM - 6: GPS time in decimal seconds since the POSIX Epoch.
* LAT - 7: WGS84 latitude in decimal degrees.
* LON - 8: WGS84 longitude in decimal degrees.
* HAC - 9: reported horizontal error in decimal meters.
* MSL - 10: altitude above Mean Sea Level in decimal meters.
* GEO - 11: altitude above WGS84 ellipse in decimal meters.
* VAC - 12: reported vertical error in decimal meters.
* SOG - 13: speed over ground in decimal knots.
* COG - 14: course over ground in decimal degrees.
* ROL - 15: roll in decimal degrees from IMU.
* PIT - 16: pitch in decimal degrees from IMU.
* YAW - 17: yaw in decimal degrees form IMU.
* RAC - 18: roll accuracy in decimal degrees.
* PAC - 19: pitch accuracy in decimal degrees.
* YAC - 20: yaw accuracy in decimal degrees.
* OBS - 21: number of survey observations.
* MAC - 22: mean accuracy of survey fix.

The peruse command supports this directly when used with a CSV file.

    peruse example csv

## csv2dat

Piping the CSV snippet into the script csv2dat produces a different readable output in fixed columns that looks like this.

I find this format more suitable for viewing the data during post-processing.

## csv2dgm

Piping the CSV snippet into the script csv2dgm and providing an IP host
address and port number like this

    csv2dgm -j -U hostname:5555

sends a subset of the CSV line to an endpoint as a UDP datagram in JSON
format. Receiving the datagrams using a command like this

    socat -u UDP6-RECV:5555 -

produces output that looks like this.

    { "NAM": "neon", "NUM": 116, "TIM": 1598455524, "LAT": 39.7943026, "LON": -105.1533253, "MSL": 1708.000, "LBL": "2020-08-26T15:25:24Z" }
    { "NAM": "neon", "NUM": 117, "TIM": 1598455525, "LAT": 39.7943030, "LON": -105.1533263, "MSL": 1708.100, "LBL": "2020-08-26T15:25:25Z" }
    { "NAM": "neon", "NUM": 118, "TIM": 1598455526, "LAT": 39.7943030, "LON": -105.1533276, "MSL": 1708.200, "LBL": "2020-08-26T15:25:26Z" }
    { "NAM": "neon", "NUM": 119, "TIM": 1598455527, "LAT": 39.7943031, "LON": -105.1533286, "MSL": 1708.300, "LBL": "2020-08-26T15:25:27Z" }
    { "NAM": "neon", "NUM": 120, "TIM": 1598455528, "LAT": 39.7943035, "LON": -105.1533300, "MSL": 1708.500, "LBL": "2020-08-26T15:25:28Z" }

This output can be processed by the fun/channel script in another project,
Tesoro, which uses this JSON and some JavaScript code to drive a moving map
display using an OpenStreetMap tile server.

The same utility can be used to send the same subset of the CSV output to
a serial port. I use this to transmit the CSV data via an Digi XBEE 3
LTE-M radio. If the XBEE is configured correctly, it can send the same
datagram to the same endpoint via LTE-M, yielding the same result as
above. I use LTE-M SIMs for AT&T's One Rate plan for this.

    csv2dgm -j -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -8 -1 -n

## csvfollow and csvplayback

The csvfollow script follows (tail -f) a CSV file being output in real-time
by gpstool and uses csv2dgm to forward the corresponding JSON datagrams to
(for example) a system that is using them to steer a moving map display.

    csvfollow 192.168.1.253:tesoro out/host/tmp/vehicle.csv

The csvplayback script uses csvmeter to meter out an existing CSV file at
approximately the same rate as it was originally generated by gpstool and
uses csv2dgm to forward the corresponding JSON datagrams to (for example)
a system that is using them to steer a moving map display.

    csvplayback 192.168.1.253:tesoro dat/yodel/20200917/vehicle.csv

See the README in the Tesoro repository for more information.

## csvdataset

The csvdataset script is a filter that reads a CSV file and produces a JSON
dataset suitable for importation into the Tesoro choosedataset feature to
create a static route map. Multiple routes can be rendered on the same map,
the the properties of the route line (color, weight, etc.) can be changed
either globally or on a per route basis.

    csvdataset < dat/yodel/20200917/vehicle.csv > 20200917.json

The entire JSON dataset has to be processed and stored in memory by Tesoro.
(This is a requirement of the underlying Leaflet third-party library.)
For very large datasets this can be problematic. One way to handle this is
to sample the CSV file. An optional value on the command line can cause
csvdataset to sample the input file. The first and last data point is always
included regardless of the sampling modulo value.

    csvdataset 10 < dat/yodel/20200917/vehicle.csv > 20200917.json

See the README in the Tesoro repository for more information.

# Memory Leaks

When testing for memory leaks, I strongly recommend using valgrind,
specfically with the full leak check option.

    valgrind --leak-check=full gpstool ...

I was surprised to find it called out a twelve byte memory leak in the
C library's locale handling, which gpstool requires to correctly display
Unicode symbols like the degree symbol. Perhaps this will be fixed in a
future GNU update (or it's a bug in my code that I can't see).

# Acknowledgements

Thanks to Charles F. F. Karney for his MIT licensed geographiclib.

Thank you to Kathy Kadnuck of the Valley Water District, who, thanks to
her collection of infrastructure survey maps, helped me to determine
the location of an old NGS survey marker in my neighborhood which,
apparently, had been buried under a sidewalk as part of a development
in the past few decades. (Remarkably, it is not illegal to landscape
over an NGS survey marker. It's merely illegal to remove or damage them.
If a municipality needs to find the marker for official business, be
prepared to have your landscaping back-hoe'ed up. And be billed for it.)

A big thank you to Brad Gabbard, a professional surveyor with
Flatirons, Inc., a surveying, engineering, and geomatics firm located
in Boulder Colorado. Mr. Gabbard generously shared some results off
his professional Trimble GPS rover taken at NGS survey marker
KK1446 that I have used to test this code.

Thanks to several manufacturers of GNSS devices, or of products that
have GNSS devices embedded within them, who, because of design flaws
and bugs in their products, led to vast improvements in this code.
No, I'm not kidding: almost every time I test a new GNSS-based product
I find the opportunity for improvement.

Special thanks to Mrs. Overclock for her assistance in road testing
(literally) this software and for her understanding regarding having
GPS equipment littered all around the house both inside and outside.
