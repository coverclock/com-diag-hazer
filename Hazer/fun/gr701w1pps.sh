# This script tests the NaviSys Technology GR-701W, a USB GPS
# device that is based on a Ublox 7 receiver. The GR-701W is
# unusual amongst GPS devices that have a USB interface in that
# it exports the 1PPS signal via data carrier detect (DCD), which
# is the reason for the "-c" option below. This script also
# configures the gpstool to forward the 1PPS signal by strobing a
# GPIO pin, the "-p" option. In this case, it uses GPIO pin 16 on
# a hardware test fixture I fabricated. I run this script on a
# Raspberry Pi as user "pi", which has access to the GPIO pins
# by virtue of being in group "gpio".
