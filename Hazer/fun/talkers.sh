# This script is specific to the GlobalSat BU-353W10. It is mostly
# the same as the script for the Navlocate GR-803G (with which it
# shares the use of the U-blox 8 chipset). But it sends two
# proprietary sentences to the BU-353W10 to cause it to [1] emit
# the satellite view (GSV) every second, and [2] emit the VTG
# sentence containing the course over ground (COG) and speed
# over ground (SOG) values every second, something the GR-803G
# does, but which the BU-353W10 does not right out of the box.
