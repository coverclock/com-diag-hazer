# This script tests the MakerFocus USB-Port-GPS, a USB GPS
# device that is based on a QuecTel L80-R receiver. The MakerFocus
# is unusual amongst GPS devices that have a USB interface in that
# it exports the 1PPS signal via via its own GPIO pin, which
# is the reason for the "-I" option below. This script also
# configures the gpstool to forward the 1PPS signal by strobing a
# GPIO pin, the "-p" option. In this case, it uses GPIO pin 16 on
# a hardware test fixture I fabricated. I run this script on a
# Raspberry Pi as user "pi", which has access to the GPIO pins
# by virtue of being in group "gpio".
