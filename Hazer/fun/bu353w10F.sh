# This script is identical to bu353w10 except that full screen
# refreshes are limited by using the -F option
# with the -E option. This works better with slow terminals
# like the Raspberry Pi console which, even at 115200 baud, cannot
# match an xterm at 100Mbps Ethernet speeds.
# If you are using a Raspberry Pi console, you might find the command
# "stty rows N" useful to change the number of lines on your remote
# terminal from 24 to N. If you're using the vim editor, you might need
# to run vim again just to get it to take on your remote terminal (that
# was my experience using "screen" from my Mac laptop).
