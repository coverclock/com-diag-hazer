# This script collects the raw output of a device into a file.
# I typically run this for about a minute to see what the device
# has to say. If it's a device I expect to use in the future, I
# save this data file in source control. I can use this file to
# test changes to Hazer and gpstool just by redirecting gpstool
# to read from this data file as if it were reading from the
# device.
