# This script tests the u-blox NEO-M8N GPS module, in my case on
# a SparkFun NEO-M8N board. The SparkFun board has a USB
# interface and the NEO-M8N provides 1PPS via a GPIO pin, which
# is the reason for the "-I" option below. This script also
# configures the gpstool to forward the 1PPS signal by strobing a
# GPIO pin, the "-p" option. In this case, it uses GPIO pin 16 on
# a hardware test fixture I fabricated. I run this script on a
# Raspberry Pi as user "pi", which has access to the GPIO pins
# by virtue of being in group "gpio".
